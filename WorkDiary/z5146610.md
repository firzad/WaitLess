## Week 1
Met with Group members and discussed the different projects. Over several days we compared 3 project proposals: waiter, outline generator and chatbot. We decided on the waiter project. Jira project was created.
## Week 2
With the project chosen, we discussed our own programming experiences to decide what framework would be best. After establishing the basics (ie. language, backend, frontend) we talked of the structure of the project. These discussions included:
* Number of epic stories
* Workflow of the restaurant (ie. interactions between customer, wait-staff and chefs)
* General scope of the project

Finally we set up an outline for our proposal milestone and divided the tasks between us. 
## Week 3
Code base for the backend was setup on the newly created github page. More specific discussion into the finer methodologies of each main epic (admin, staff, customer and kitchen) including UI design for the proposal. A new group member joined, time was spent getting her opinions and feedback on what has currently been done. Work done on the proposal, to be due on Sunday. Epic stories were expanded upon. 

## Week 4
Investigation into material UI and react, sample projects setup to try out different templates

## Week 5
